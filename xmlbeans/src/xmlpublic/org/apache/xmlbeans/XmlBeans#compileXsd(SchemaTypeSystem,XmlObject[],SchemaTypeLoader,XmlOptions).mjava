    /**
     * <p>Returns the SchemaTypeSystem that results from augumenting the
     * SchemaTypeSystem passed in by incrementally adding the given XML
     * schema definitions.</p>
     *
     * <p>These could be new definitions (if the Schema document is not recorded into
     * the existing SchemaTypeSystem), modifications to the already existing
     * definitions (if the Schema document is already recorded in the existing
     * SchemaTypeSystem), or deletions (if the Schema document is already recorded
     * in the existing SchemaTypeSystem and the new definitions are empty).
     * The identity of documents is established using
     * {@link XmlDocumentProperties#getSourceName}, so if the caller choses to
     * construct the Schema definitions using other methods than parsing an
     * XML document, they should make sure that the names returned by that
     * method are consistent with the caller's intent (add/modify).</p>
     *
     * <p>The XmlObjects passed in should be w3c &lt;schema&gt; elements whose type
     * is org.w3c.x2001.xmlSchema.Schema. (That is, schema elements in
     * the XML namespace http://www.w3c.org/2001/XMLSchema.)  Also
     * org.w3c.x2001.xmlSchema.SchemaDocument is permitted.</p>
     *
     * <p>The optional second argument is a SchemaTypeLoader which will be
     * consulted for already-compiled schema types which may be linked
     * while processing the given schemas.</p>
     *
     * <p>The SchemaTypeSystem that is returned should be combined
     * (via {@link #typeLoaderUnion}) with the typepath typeloader in order
     * to create a typeloader that can be used for creating and validating
     * instances.</p>
     *
     * <p>Use the <em>options</em> parameter to specify the following:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>A collection instance that should be used as an error listener during
     * compilation, as described in {@link XmlOptions#setErrorListener}.</li>
     * <li>Whether validation should not be done when building the SchemaTypeSystem,
     * as described in {@link XmlOptions#setCompileNoValidation}.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param schemas The schema definitions from which to build the schema type system.
     * @param typepath The path to already-compiled schema types for linking while processing.
     * @param options Options specifying an error listener and/or validation behavior.
