    /**
     * Returns a new stream containing standard XML text, encoded

     *
     * The byte stream contains contents starting at the current
     * begin-tag or begin-document and ending at the matching
     * end-tag or end-document.  The specified encoding is used
     * and also emitted in a PI at the beginning of the stream.

     * This is a fail-fast stream, so if the underlying data is changed
     * while the stream is being read, the stream throws a
     * ConcurrentModificationException.
     *
     * Throws an IllegalStateException if the XmlTokenSource is not
     * positioned at begin-tag or begin-document (e.g., if it is at
     * an attribute).
