     * Returns a new character reader containing XML text.

     * the matching end-tag or end-document.  No encoding annotation

     * while the reader is being read, the reader throws a
     * ConcurrentModificationException.
     *
     * Throws an IllegalStateException if the XmlTokenSource is not
     * positioned at begin-tag or begin-document (e.g., if it is at
     * an attribute).
