    /**
     * Returns an XML string for this XML object.
     * <p>
     * The string is pretty-printed.  If you want a non-pretty-printed
     * string, or if you want to control options precisely, use the
     * xmlText() methods.
     * <p>
     * Note that when producing XML any object other than very root of the
     * document, then you are guaranteed to be looking at only a fragment
     * of XML, i.e., just the contents of an element or attribute, and
     * and we will produce a string that starts with an <code>&lt;xml-fragment&gt;</code> tag.
     * The XmlOptions.setSaveOuter() option on xmlText can be used to produce
     * the actual element name above the object if you wish.
