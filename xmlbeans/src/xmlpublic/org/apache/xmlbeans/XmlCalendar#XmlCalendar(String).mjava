    /**
     * Constructs an XmlCalendar for a standard XML
     * schema formatted date string.
     * 
     * The parser accepts any of the following formats:
     * 
     * YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss          - dateTime
     * YYYY-MM-DD                   - date
     *            hh:mm:ss          - time
     * YYYY                         - gYear
     *    --MM                      - gMonth
     *      ---DD                   - gDay
     * 
     * The parser actually accepts all 16 combinations of subsets of
     * fields (Y, M, D, T) using the same scheme, even for combinations
     * that are not defined as types in the schema spec, such as
     * year, day, and time:
     * 
     * YYYY--DDThh:mm:ss            - [everything but month specified]
     * 
     * In the string, each field must be padded to its full width, for
     * example, January must be --01, not just --1.
     * 
     * In particular, a year must be padded to at least four digits, so
     * "98" is not a valid year, although "1998" and "0098" are both valid
     * years, unambiguously 19 centuries separated from each other.  A year
     * may also be preceded by a minus symbol: -0001 is 1 BC and -0002 is
     * 2 BC.
     *
     * Finally a timezone is always allowed (yet optional) at the end.
     * Timezones must be either "Z" (UTC, which we translate to GMT),
     * or simple offsets from UTC in the range "-14:00" to "+14:00",
     * for example: "14:30:00-05:00" specifies 2:30 PM in the
     * afternoon at UTC-05:00, which is the same as EST.
     * 
     * If a timezone is not specified, the default TimeZone is used.
