     * Returns the type of the current token. By definition, the current
     * token is the token immediately to the right of the cursor. 
     * If you're in the middle of text, before a character, you get TEXT.
     * You can't dive into the text of an ATTR, COMMENT or PROCINST.<br/><br/>

     * As an alternative, it may be more convenient for you to use one of the 
     * methods that test for a particular token type. These include the methods 
     * isStart(), isStartdoc(), isText(), isAttr(), and so on. Each returns a boolean 
     * value indicating whether the token that follows the cursor is the type 
     * in question.

     * @return  The TokenType instance for the token at the cursor's current
