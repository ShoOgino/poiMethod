     * Gets the text value of the current document, element, attribute,

     *
     * When getting the text value of an element, non-text content such
     * as comments and processing instructions are ignored and text is concatenated.
     * For elements that have nested element children, this
     * returns the concatenated text of all mixed content and the
     * text of all the element children, recursing in first-to-last
     * depthfirst order.<br/><br/>
     *
     * For attributes, including namespaces, this returns the attribute value.<br/><br/>
     *
     * For comments and processing instructions, this returns the text content 
     * of the comment or PI, not including the delimiting sequences &lt;!-- --&gt;, &lt;? ?&gt;.
     * For a PI, the name of the PI is also not included.
     *<br/><br/>
     * The value of an empty tag is the empty string.<br/><br/>
     *
     * If the current token is END or ENDDOC, this throws an {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}.<br/><br/>     
     * 
     * @return  The text value of the current token if the token's type is
     * START, STARTDOC, TEXT, ATTR, COMMENT, PROCINST, or NAMESPACE; null 
     * if the type is NONE.
