     * where the year/month and the day/hour/minute/second
     * offsets are of opposite sign. Days cannot be carried
     * into months since the length of a Gregorian month is
     * variable depending on when the duration is applied.
     * In these cases, this method normalizes the components
     * so that "day" is the only negative component.
