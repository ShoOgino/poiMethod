     * Associates the specified value with the specified property. If there was
     * already a value associated with this property, the old value is replaced.
     * <p>
     * The valid property names include <code>WRITE_XML_DECLARATION</code> and
     * <code>CHARACTER_SET_ENCODING</code>. All of these standard SAAJ
     * properties are prefixed by "javax.xml.soap". Vendors may also add
     * implementation specific properties. These properties must be prefixed
     * with package names that are unique to the vendor.
     * <p>
     * Setting the property <code>WRITE_XML_DECLARATION</code> to
     * <code>"true"</code> will cause an XML Declaration to be written out at
     * the start of the SOAP message. The default value of "false" suppresses
     * this declaration.
     * <p>
     * The property <code>CHARACTER_SET_ENCODING</code> defaults to the value
     * <code>"utf-8"</code> which causes the SOAP message to be encoded using
     * UTF-8. Setting <code>CHARACTER_SET_ENCODING</code> to
     * <code>"utf-16"</code> causes the SOAP message to be encoded using UTF-16.
     * <p>
     * Some implementations may allow encodings in addition to UTF-8 and UTF-16.
     * Refer to your vendor's documentation for details.
     *
