    /**
     * Loads - reads in and converts into an array of byte(s) - an image from
     * a named file.
     *
     * Note: this method should be modified so that the type of the image may
     * also be passed to it. Currently, it assumes that all images are
     * JPG/JPEG(s).
     *
     * @param imageFilename A String that encapsulates the path to and name
     *                      of the file that contains the image which is to be
     *                      'loaded'.
     * @return An array of type byte that contains the raw data of the named
     *         image.
     * @throws java.io.FileNotFoundException Thrown if it was not possible to
     *                                       open the specified file.
     * @throws java.io.IOException Thrown if reading the file failed or was
     *                             interrupted.
