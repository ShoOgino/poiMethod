   * Sets the first formula for this object .
   * A formula is divided into three parts : first formula , operator and second formula .
   * In other words , a formula contains a left oprand , an operator and a right operand.
   * This is the general rule . An example is 1<= value <=5 . In this case ,
   * the left operand ( or the first formula ) is the number 1 . The operator is
   * OPERATOR_BETWEEN and the right operand ( or the second formula ) is 5 .
   * But there are cases when a second formula isn't needed :
   * You want somethink like : all values less than 5 . In this case , there's only a first
   * formula ( in our case 5 ) and the operator OPERATOR_LESS_THAN
