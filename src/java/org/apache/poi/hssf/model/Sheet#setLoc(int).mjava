     * create method.  So you probably shouldn't mess with this unless you have
     * a compelling reason why or the help for the method you're calling says so.
     * Check the other methods for whether they care about
     * the loc pointer.  Many of the "modify" and "remove" methods re-initialize this
     * to "dimsloc" which is the location of the Dimensions Record and presumably the
     * start of the value section (at or around 19 dec).
