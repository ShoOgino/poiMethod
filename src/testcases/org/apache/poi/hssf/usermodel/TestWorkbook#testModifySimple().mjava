    /**
     * TEST NAME:  Test Modify Sheet Simple <P>
     * OBJECTIVE:  Test that HSSF can read a simple spreadsheet with a string value and replace
     *             it with another string value.<P>
     * SUCCESS:    HSSF reads a sheet.  HSSF replaces the cell value with another cell value. HSSF
     *             writes the sheet out to another file.  HSSF reads the result and ensures the value
     *             has been properly replaced.    <P>
     * FAILURE:    HSSF does not read a sheet or excepts.  HSSF does not write the sheet or excepts.
     *             HSSF does not re-read the sheet or excepts.  Upon re-reading the sheet the value
     *             is incorrect or has not been replaced. <P>
