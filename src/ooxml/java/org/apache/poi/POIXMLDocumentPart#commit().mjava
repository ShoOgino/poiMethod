    /**
     * Save the content in the underlying package part.
     * Default implementation is empty meaning that the package part is left unmodified.
     *
     * Sub-classes should override and add logic to marshal the "model" into Ooxml4J.
     *
     * For example, the code saving a generic XML entry may look as follows:
     * <pre><code>
     * protected void commit() throws IOException {
     *   PackagePart part = getPackagePart();
     *   OutputStream out = part.getOutputStream();
     *   XmlObject bean = getXmlBean(); //the "model" which holds changes in memory
     *   bean.save(out, DEFAULT_XML_OPTIONS);
     *   out.close();
     * }
     *  </code></pre>
     *
     */
    protected void commit() throws IOException {

    }
