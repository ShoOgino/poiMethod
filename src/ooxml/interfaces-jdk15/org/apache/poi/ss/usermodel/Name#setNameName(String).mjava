     * <ul>
     *   <li><strong>Valid characters</strong>
     *   The first character of a name must be a letter, an underscore character (_), or a backslash (\).
     *   Remaining characters in the name can be letters, numbers, periods, and underscore characters.
     *   </li>
     *   <li><strong>Cell references disallowed</strong>

     *   <li><strong>Spaces are not valid</strong>
     *   Spaces are not allowed as part of a name. Use the underscore character (_) and period (.) as word separators, such as, Sales_Tax or First.Quarter.
     *   </li>
     *   <li><strong>Name length</strong>
     *    A name can contain up to 255 characters.
     *   </li>
